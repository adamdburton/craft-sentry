Features
=================
 - Log Craft Errors/Exceptions to Sentry
 - Logs the environment you're working on
 - Integrates seamlessly, one click install
 - You can limit what pages get JS Raven loaded on them by applying a page filter.
 - You can limit which HTTP error codes get reported to sentry in the settings (for example, if you don't want to report 400 or 404 errors).

Setup
=================
Two ways to configure the plugin:

* Enter Sentry DSN or public DSN (for JS reporting) via Plugin settings \
**or** 
* Via your server's environment (loaded `$_ENV['sentryDsn']` and `$_ENV['sentryPublicDsn']`)
 
Important:
=================
The plugin's folder should be named "sentry"
